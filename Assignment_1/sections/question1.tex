For a directed graph \(G=(V,E)\). For each vertex \(v \in V\) let \(\delta^+(v)\) be the set of outgiong edges from \(v\) and \(\delta^-(v)\) be the set of incoming edges to \(v\).\\
Given is that each a \textit{b}-flow under the following constraints
\begin{align}
\sum_{e\in \delta^-(v)} x_e - \sum_{e\in \delta^+(v)} x_e =&\, b_v, \forall v \in V\\
0 \leq x_e \leq&\, u_e, \forall e \in E
\end{align}
