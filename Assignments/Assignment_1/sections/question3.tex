\section{Exercise 3}
\subsection{Exercise 3.1}

We start here with \(I_0\), where there is the constraint \( l_e \le x_e \le u_e, \forall e \in E \)
\( l_e \in \mathbb{R} \cup -\infty\),  \( u_e \in \mathbb{R} \cup +\infty\) 

If we take an edge \(e\) from \(u\) to \(v\),then  if \(x_e <\) 0  we can say that flow is going in the other direction, i.e. along \((v,u)\). As a flow is defined in a graph that does not have anti-parallel edges we cannot have flow going in both directions, and then we introduce a new vertex, say \(w\). To ensure we are not altering the possible max-flow of the network, we say that b_{w} has value 0 and the cost from \((u,w)->(w,v)\) will have the same cost as the edge \((u,v)\). Now one of 3 possibilities exists.\newline
First, the flow with value \(u_e\) cancels out the flow from \(l_e\) and \(l_e\) becomes zero.
Second, the flow with value \(l_e\) cancels out the flow from \(u_e\) and \(u_e\) becomes zero.
Finally, the forward flow and backward flow cancel each other out and then both become zero.

Doing this we ensure that there is at least one of \(l_e\) or \(u_e\) bounded and finite.


\subsection{Exercise 3.3}
We start here with \(I_2\), where there is the constraint \[ l_e \le x_e \le u_e, \forall e \in E.
 l_e \in \R, finite. \( u_e \in \R \cup +\infty\] 

Now we have two situations. Either \(l_e<0\) or \(l_e > 0\).\newline
If \(l_e<0\): Then we can modify the the flow \(f\) in the original problem to \(f'\) in the new augmented problem with constraint: \[ 0 \le x_e + l_e \le u_e + l_e\]
In the augmented problem \(b'_u = b_u + l_e\) and \(b'_v = b_v - l_e\)

If \(l_e>0\): Then we can modify the the flow \(f\) in the original problem to \(f'\) in the new augmented problem with constraint: \[ 0 \le x_e - l_e \le u_e - l_e\]
In the augmented problem \(b'_u = b_u - l_e\) and \(b'_v = b_v + l_e\)

These new augmented problems can then be solved using an algorithm to solve MCFP and will have the same flow as the original problem \(I_2\)


\subsection{Exercise 3.4}
We were given \(I_0\) and instance of a GMCFP, with a directed graph \(G =(V,E)\), in Exercises 3.1 and 3.2 we introduced at most one node and two edges to the modified problem in each of them.
