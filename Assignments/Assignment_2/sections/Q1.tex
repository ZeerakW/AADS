\section{Hash functions for sampling}
\subsection{Exercise 1}
\subsubsection{(a)}

We are asked to prove \(p \leq Pr[h_m(x)/m < p] \leq 1.01p\).
We will use various facts to show this. Firstly that \(h(x) = h_m(x)/m\) is a Strong Universal Hash Function, secondly as we are give \(p \ge 100/m \) this implies that \(p/100\ge 1/m\), thirdly \(h_m(x)/m \le p \) implies \(h_m(x) \le mp  \)  and finally we will use that for any \(y\),   \(y \leq \lceil y \rceil < y+1\).

We observe that
\begin{align*}
	& Pr[h_m(x)/m < p] \\
	&= \sum_{0 \leq k < mp} Pr[h_m(x) = k] \\
	&= \sum_{0 \leq k < mp} \frac{1}{m} \\
	&= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{0 \leq k < mp} 1 \\
	&= \frac{1}{m} \left| [0,mp) \right| \\
	&= \frac{1}{m} \cdot \lceil mp \rceil \\
	&= \frac{\lceil mp \rceil}{m}
\end{align*}

Thus we conclude
\begin{align*}
	p 	&= \frac{pm}{m} \leq Pr[h_m(x)/m < p] = \frac{\lceil pm \rceil}{m} \leq \frac{pm+1}{m} 
		\leq p + \frac{p}{100} = 1.01p
\end{align*}
